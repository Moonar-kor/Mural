""Adoration of the Shepherds"" was made in 1570-1571 by Giorgio Vasari. Vasari recorded in his Ricordanze (diary), that this piece of art was commisioned by the nuns of the Florentine church of Santo Stefano in Pane. In its original setting, it hangs above the altar table, which places the Christ child at eye level with the viewer. Vasari used elements of the Mannerist style by doing twisted poses, expressive gestures, the compression of space, and the use of acidic colors, such as pink and greens.","Walk out of the North Entrance of the Elvehjem building, walk across to the Chazen Museum of Art.",CHArt.jpg
